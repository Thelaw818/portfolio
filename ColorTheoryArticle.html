        <h2>Introduction to Color Theory</h2>
        <p>Color theory is a fundamental concept in design, art, and visual communication. It explores the relationship between colors, the psychological impact of color choices, and how colors can be combined to create harmonious designs. Understanding color theory helps designers and artists make informed decisions about color combinations to evoke specific moods, attract attention, and enhance the aesthetics of a composition.</p>

        <h2>The Color Wheel</h2>
        <p>The color wheel is a circular diagram used to show the relationships between colors. It is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary colors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Colors:</strong> Red, Blue, Yellow – the foundation for all other colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Colors:</strong> Orange, Green, Purple – formed by mixing two primary colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Tertiary Colors:</strong> Yellow-Orange, Red-Orange, Red-Purple, Blue-Purple, Blue-Green, Yellow-Green – made by mixing a primary color with a secondary color.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By understanding the color wheel, you can create color schemes based on color relationships such as complementary, analogous, and triadic colors.</p>

        <h2>Complementary Colors</h2>
        <p>Complementary colors are located opposite each other on the color wheel. When placed together, they create high contrast and can make each color appear more vibrant. Some examples of complementary color pairs include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Red and Green</li>
            <li>Blue and Orange</li>
            <li>Yellow and Purple</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="image">

            <p>Complementary colors create high contrast and make each color stand out.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Analogous Colors</h2>
        <p>Analogous colors are next to each other on the color wheel. They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs. For example, the combination of blue, blue-green, and green is an analogous color scheme.</p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="https://github.com/Thelaw818/portfolio/blob/main/images/Analogous%20Colors.jpg?raw=true" alt="Analogous Colors">
            <p>Analogous colors create harmony and cohesion in a design.</p>

        <h2>RGB Color Wheel</h2>
        <p>The RGB color model is based on the primary colors Red, Green, and Blue. It is widely used in digital design, as it aligns with how colors are displayed on screens.</p>
        <div class="image">

        <h2>Color Psychology</h2>
        <p>Colors have a psychological impact on the viewer. Different colors can evoke different emotions and reactions. Here's how some colors are perceived:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> Passion, energy, excitement, love</li>
            <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Calm, trust, professionalism</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Happiness, optimism, attention-grabbing</li>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> Nature, growth, tranquility</li>
            <li><strong>Purple:</strong> Luxury, creativity, mystery</li>
            <li><strong>Black:</strong> Sophistication, elegance, authority</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Designers use these psychological associations to influence how people perceive a brand or message. For more on color psychology, check out this <a href="https://www.colorpsychology.org/" target="_blank">comprehensive guide on color psychology</a>.</p>

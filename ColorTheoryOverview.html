  <h2>What is Color Theory?</h2>
  <p>Color theory is a set of guidelines that describe the relationships between colors. It's a crucial aspect of art, design, and other visual fields, helping artists and designers create harmonious and impactful color palettes.  Understanding color theory allows for the effective communication of ideas and emotions through visual design.</p>

      <!Key Color Theory Terms

    Color Wheel: A circular diagram of colors arranged by their chromatic relationship, typically including primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.

    Primary Colors: The three base colors (red, blue, and yellow) that cannot be made by mixing other colors.

    Secondary Colors: Colors formed by mixing two primary colors (e.g., green, orange, purple).

    Tertiary Colors: Colors made by mixing a primary color with a neighboring secondary color (e.g., red-orange, blue-green).

    Hue: The pure color without any tint (addition of white) or shade (addition of black).

    Saturation: The intensity or purity of a color; highly saturated colors are vivid, while low-saturation colors appear dull.

    Value: The lightness or darkness of a color, determined by the amount of white or black added.

    Tint: A lighter version of a color created by adding white.

    Shade: A darker version of a color created by adding black.

    Tone: A version of a color created by adding gray, reducing its intensity.

    Warm Colors: Colors associated with warmth, such as red, orange, and yellow.

    Cool Colors: Colors associated with coolness, such as blue, green, and purple.

    Complementary Colors: Colors opposite each other on the color wheel (e.g., blue and orange), creating high contrast.

    Analogous Colors: Colors next to each other on the color wheel (e.g., blue, blue-green, green) that create harmonious designs.

    Triadic Colors: A group of three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel (e.g., red, blue, yellow).

    Monochromatic Colors: Variations of a single hue using tints, shades, and tones.

    Split Complementary Colors: A color and the two colors adjacent to its complementary color, offering strong contrast with less tension.

    Color Temperature: The perceived warmth or coolness of a color, influencing mood and visual balance.

    Neutral Colors: Colors like white, black, gray, and beige that don't strongly lean towards warm or cool.

    Color Harmony: A pleasing arrangement of colors that creates balance and a sense of order.>
